Network Level Authentication (NLA) is a security feature for Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections in Windows. If you need to disable NLA for any reason, you can use the following methods via command line or PowerShell.

1. Using PowerShell
To disable NLA via PowerShell, execute the following command:

powershell
Copy code
Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\WinStations\RDP-Tcp" -Name "UserAuthentication" -Value 0
This sets the UserAuthentication registry value to 0, effectively disabling NLA.

2. Using Command Prompt (via Registry Editor)
Run this command in an elevated Command Prompt:

cmd
Copy code
reg add "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\WinStations\RDP-Tcp" /v UserAuthentication /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
3. Using Group Policy Command Line (if managed by GPO)
You can disable NLA by modifying the group policy setting via the Local Group Policy or Group Policy Editor. However, you can also do it using command-line tools by targeting the relevant policy.

4. Restart RDP Service
After making changes, restart the RDP service to apply the settings:

cmd
Copy code
net stop termservice
net start termservice
Alternatively, you can reboot the system.

Verification
After disabling NLA, verify the status with PowerShell:

powershell
Copy code
(Get-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\WinStations\RDP-Tcp").UserAuthentication
If the result is 0, NLA is disabled.

Important Notes
Security Risks: Disabling NLA reduces security by allowing unauthenticated connections to reach the RDP session login screen. Ensure this is done only in a controlled environment.
Re-enabling NLA: To re-enable NLA, set the UserAuthentication value back to 1:
powershell
Copy code
Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\WinStations\RDP-Tcp" -Name "UserAuthentication" -Value 1
